      <h2>1. HR Service</h2>
      <p>When you already know what profiles you need — from developers, QAs, and DevOps to team leads, tech leads, or engineering managers — we source, validate, and integrate them into your team, ensuring the right technical and leadership balance for your project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular 1-on-1s and motivation tracking</li>
        <li>Engagement and retention monitoring</li>
        <li>Continuous, transparent insights that enable early action before issues affect delivery performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You stay focused on product and delivery — we make sure the people behind it stay motivated, aligned, and growing.</p>
      <p><strong>Advanced HR Service</strong> extends from ongoing monitoring to organizational consulting — exploring insights, identifying patterns, and designing solutions that strengthen your culture and structure.</p>
      <p><em>Scope can include:</em> organizational design and team optimization; culture alignment and values integration; implementation of performance-management systems; leadership support and retention strategy development.</p>
      <p><strong>Focus:</strong> understand human dynamics, validate root causes, and co-create solutions that sustain team health and performance.</p>

      <h2>2. CTO Service</h2>
      <p>When you’re not sure what you need — or want clearer delivery visibility — our CTO function steps in.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring delivery results and outcomes</strong> to create data-driven visibility and ensure predictable sprint performance</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking cycle time and throughput</strong> to provide actionable insights and feedback for continuous improvement</li>
        <li><strong>Reviewing workload balance and delivery efficiency</strong> based on tracked time and output trends</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Advanced CTO Service</strong> shifts from monitoring to collaboration — exploring insights, diagnosing challenges, and shaping solutions with your leadership.</p>
      <p><em>Scope can include:</em> technical or process audits; architecture and infrastructure review when tech debt or scalability issues arise; delivery flow and process design optimization; role definitions, collaboration improvements, and team-communication design; implementation support for applied improvements.</p>
      <p><strong>Focus:</strong> understand the problem, validate the cause, and co-create solutions that keep engineering predictable and scalable.</p>

    <section id="continuous-improvement">
      <h2>3. Continuous Improvement Service</h2>
      <p>The Continuous Improvement Service grows out of collaboration between HR and CTO — whether at baseline or advanced level. It’s where data turns into action, and action turns into measurable growth.</p>
      <p>This service focuses on turning everyday feedback and delivery insights into <strong>strategic improvements</strong> — helping both teams learn, adapt, and outperform KPIs together.</p>
      <p>Depending on depth of collaboration, it can extend into the <strong>client’s business layer</strong> — working jointly to identify growth bottlenecks, improve planning accuracy, and translate operational data into business outcomes.</p>
      <p>Not a formal consulting phase — a <strong>living partnership</strong> built around continuous learning and smarter decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>Focus:</strong> grow together — outperform KPIs, not just track them.</p>
