      <h2>Under the Hood: How It Works</h2>
      <p>Beneath every engagement is a simple principle — <strong>build it like your own office</strong>, powered by Reaktivate’s Operational, HR, and CTO layers that work in sync. Each layer scales from a baseline to an advanced collaboration level.</p>

              <p>At the core of every engagement, Reaktivate provides an <strong>Operational Service</strong> — the foundation that keeps your remote office running smoothly, legally, and productively.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Payroll and contractor management</strong> – we handle payments, invoicing, and compliance so you don’t have to.</li>
                <li><strong>Contracts and legal administration</strong> – secure, compliant agreements with clear IP and confidentiality terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Workspace readiness and equipment support</strong> – no office costs by default; the setup just works. Expand anytime through client‑defined budgets.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational readiness and onboarding</strong> – smooth ramp‑up for new hires, account access, and environment preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Time tracking and reporting</strong> – transparent hours, billing summaries, and visibility without extra admin load.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This layer guarantees <strong>operational stability</strong> — your collaboration starts ready‑to‑work from day one, with no hidden logistics or paperwork slowing you down.</p>
              <p>Even when clients choose to exclude HR or CTO baseline services, the <strong>Operational Service remains mandatory</strong>, ensuring a productive foundation for every team member and protecting the integrity of the engagement.</p>
              <p><strong>Focus:</strong> no headaches, no friction — just operational clarity and productivity from day one.</p>
