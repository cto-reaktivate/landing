    <h2>Built for Your Stage</h2>
    <div class="grid-3">
      <div>
        <h3>🚀 Startups</h3>
        <p>You’re racing against time and budget — every wrong hire, delay, or technical misstep burns runway. We give you an instantly operational remote office so you can build fast, stay lean, and focus on validation instead of recruiting or managing chaos.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>📈 Scaleups</h3>
        <p>As you grow, coordination and consistency start breaking. You’ve got strong developers but uneven delivery, missed sprint goals, and growing friction. We plug in a performance layer — HR keeps people aligned, CTO keeps results predictable — so you scale without losing speed or clarity.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>🏢 Product Teams</h3>
        <p>Your product runs, but growth stalls under invisible inefficiencies — tech debt, burnout, or lack of visibility. We embed our HR-CTO collaboration model into your existing structure to uncover bottlenecks, restore balance, and raise delivery performance sustainably.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Reaktivate operates as your remote office — powered by HR and CTO leadership layers. When you know who you need, HR ensures motivation and alignment; when you don’t, CTO ensures visibility, results, and improvement. Both work together on a solid operational base.</p>

    <h2>Built-In Leadership Model</h2>
    <p>Every Reaktivate collaboration runs under dual leadership — <strong>CTO + HR</strong> working together to keep delivery measurable and people motivated.</p>
    <p>This balance ensures your remote office doesn’t just operate — it grows, learns, and adapts with you.</p>
