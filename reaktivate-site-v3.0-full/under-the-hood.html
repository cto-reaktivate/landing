  <h1>Under the Hood</h1>
  <p>Every collaboration with Reaktivate is structured around three layers — Operational, HR, and CTO — connected by a Continuous Improvement loop.</p>

  <section id="operational">
    <h2>1. Operational Service — The Ground Layer</h2>
    <p>The foundation that keeps your remote office running smoothly, legally, and productively.</p>
    <details><summary>Read the full version</summary>
    <div class="details-body"><p>At the core of every engagement, Reaktivate provides an Operational Service — the foundation that keeps your remote office running smoothly, legally, and productively. You don’t pay for an office that doesn’t exist — it simply works. Payroll, contracts, and transparent reporting form the base for stable delivery. And if you want to upgrade your setup — define workspace budgets, equipment support, or bonuses — it’s fully extendable.</p></div>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section id="hr">
    <h2>2. HR Service — The Human Layer</h2>
    <p>We keep your team motivated, aligned, and growing through continuous engagement tracking and feedback.</p>
    <details><summary>Read the full version</summary>
    <div class="details-body"><p>Human health and performance are tracked through regular 1‑on‑1s, motivation checks, and transparent client summaries for each team member. You get continuous insights to act early before issues affect delivery. Advanced HR expands into organizational consulting, culture development, and implementation of performance management frameworks — the structure behind healthy, scalable growth.</p></div>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section id="cto">
    <h2>3. CTO Service — The Engineering Layer</h2>
    <p>Monitors delivery outcomes, throughput, and efficiency — ensuring predictability and progress.</p>
    <details><summary>Read the full version</summary>
    <div class="details-body"><p>Baseline CTO focuses on visibility — monitoring delivery results, tracking cycle time and throughput, and reviewing efficiency per tracked hour. The data includes commits to repositories, activity in task trackers, and collaboration metrics from communication tools. This enables data‑driven decision making. Advanced CTO covers architecture reviews, process optimization, and collaboration audits — helping teams scale quality without chaos.</p></div>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section id="ci">
    <h2>4. Continuous Improvement — The Learning Loop</h2>
    <p>Connects HR and CTO data to transform insights into actions that improve both people and performance.</p>
    <details><summary>Read the full version</summary>
    <div class="details-body"><p>Continuous Improvement connects HR and CTO insights to detect patterns — late reviews, overwork, scope creep — and act early. It’s not a service, it’s the result of well‑balanced collaboration. This loop transforms data into action and action into growth, keeping your delivery sustainable and evolving.</p></div>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section id="leadership">
    <h2>Built-In Leadership Model — CTO × HR Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Reaktivate’s leadership model connects the technical and human sides of performance. The CTO focuses on delivery metrics, while HR focuses on motivation and retention.</p>
    <details><summary>Read the full version</summary>
    <div class="details-body"><p>The HR and CTO functions don’t compete — they complete each other. CTO tracks delivery metrics, HR tracks human factors. Together they detect issues early: CTO shows <em>what</em> is off track, HR explains <em>why</em>, and both propose <em>how</em> to fix it before it impacts results. When a client already has their own CTO or HR, we adapt — collaborating to share insights, not override authority. This balance of perspectives makes distributed teams predictable and sustainable.</p></div>
    </details>
  </section>

  <section id="integration">
    <h2>How the Layers Work Together</h2>
    <p>Each Reaktivate collaboration starts with a stable operational base, gains predictability through HR and CTO oversight, and evolves through Continuous Improvement — creating a learning system that grows with your business.</p>
