    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Reaktivate operates as your remote office — powered by HR and CTO leadership layers. When you know who you need, HR ensures motivation and alignment; when you don’t, CTO ensures visibility, results, and improvement. Both work together on a solid operational base.</p>

    <h3>Operational Service</h3>
    <p>The foundation — payroll, contracts, compliance, onboarding, and reporting — everything that keeps your remote office productive and headache‑free. You don’t pay for an office; it just works. You may later add workspace budgets to upgrade setups if needed.</p>

    <h3>HR Service</h3>
    <p>Our built‑in HR layer ensures emotional health, retention, and motivation through regular 1‑on‑1s, team monitoring, and transparent insights. You stay focused on delivery — we ensure the people behind it stay motivated and aligned. Advanced HR can include organizational consulting, performance systems, and leadership support.</p>

    <h3>CTO Service</h3>
    <p>The CTO layer provides results monitoring and delivery visibility — tracking throughput, cycle time, and efficiency per hour worked. The advanced service can extend to architecture reviews, process optimization, and collaboration design — or be performed collaboratively with your own CTO.</p>

    <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>Combining HR and CTO data into one loop to convert insights into performance improvements. It’s how we transform daily operations into measurable growth, evolving collaboration without bureaucracy.</p>
