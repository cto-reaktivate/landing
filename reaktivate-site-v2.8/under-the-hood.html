    <h1>Under the Hood: How Reaktivate Works</h1>
    <p>Every collaboration with Reaktivate is built like a remote office — structured around three operational layers with a Continuous Improvement loop connecting them.</p>

    <section id="operational">
      <h2>1. Operational Service — The Ground Layer</h2>
      <p>The foundation that keeps your remote office running smoothly, legally, and productively. We handle contracts, payroll, compliance, and onboarding so you can stay focused on building products.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payroll & contractor management</li>
        <li>Contracts, invoicing, and compliance</li>
        <li>Workspace readiness — no rent, no friction</li>
        <li>Onboarding and operational readiness</li>
        <li>Time tracking and transparent reporting</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="hr">
      <h2>2. HR Service — The Human Layer</h2>
      <p>The HR layer ensures your team stays aligned, motivated, and emotionally healthy. We hold regular 1‑on‑1s, track engagement, and provide transparent insights to help prevent burnout and misalignment before they affect performance.</p>
      <p><strong>Advanced HR Service</strong> extends into culture, structure, and performance consulting — creating systems that grow with your team.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cto">
      <h2>3. CTO Service — The Engineering Layer</h2>
      <p>The CTO layer monitors delivery results, throughput, and efficiency — ensuring predictability and progress. It’s where technical insight meets measurable performance.</p>
      <p><strong>Advanced CTO Service</strong> adds architectural and process consulting, delivery optimization, and collaboration design — to turn data into decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ci">
      <h2>4. Continuous Improvement — The Learning Loop</h2>
      <p>Continuous Improvement connects HR and CTO layers — turning insights and metrics into strategic actions. It’s how teams evolve together and outperform KPIs, not just track them.</p>
      <p>This loop can also expand into the client’s business layer, aligning operational data with strategic outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="integration">
      <h2>How the Layers Work Together</h2>
      <p>Each Reaktivate collaboration starts with an operational base, gains stability through HR and CTO oversight, and matures through continuous improvement. Together, they create a living system that learns, adapts, and performs.</p>
