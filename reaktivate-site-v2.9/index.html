  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Reaktivate operates as your remote office — powered by HR and CTO leadership layers. When you know who you need, HR ensures motivation and alignment; when you don’t, CTO ensures visibility, results, and improvement. Both work together on a solid operational base.</p>

    <h2>Built-In Leadership Model</h2>
    <p>Every Reaktivate collaboration runs under dual leadership — <strong>CTO + HR</strong> working together to keep delivery measurable and people motivated.</p>
    <p>This balance ensures your remote office doesn’t just operate — it grows, learns, and adapts with you.</p>
