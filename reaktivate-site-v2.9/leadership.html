  <h1>Built-In Leadership Model — CTO × HR Collaboration</h1>
  <p>The leadership model behind Reaktivate connects technology, people, and delivery in one continuous system.</p>
  <p>CTO oversees the measurable side: throughput, delivery results, code standards, and team velocity. HR oversees the human side: motivation, alignment, and engagement. Their collaboration ensures that data reflects reality and people stay aligned with goals.</p>
  <p>When clients already have their own CTO or HR, Reaktivate integrates seamlessly — acting as a complementary layer for monitoring, insight, and stability.</p>
  <p>This shared leadership model guarantees that your team’s performance and well-being evolve together — not as separate tracks, but as one process of learning and improvement.</p>
